# Kram - A class based scripting language

[![Build Status](https://semaphoreci.com/api/v1/projects/4dd50ed2-e0bd-4694-924e-9d9a14fcae01/487253/shields_badge.svg)](https://semaphoreci.com/zegl/kram-cpp)

**Note:** This is not the same thing as [kram/kram](https://github.com/kram/kram), but is a rewrite that probably will be merged to kram/kram in the future (and replace it).
